## Hello World!

My name is Meghan and I am tired

**Reasons why I am tired :tired_face::**
1. It's dead week
2. I have a java assignment due Thursday
  * It's the hardest assignment of the semester.
3. I got no sleep

**Here is a picture of my dog:**

### My favorite quote:

\* I think this should be used for Italics and the italics markup language should be used for astrics it seems more logical \*
